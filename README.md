This is a fully serverless AI chatbot built with Amazon Bedrock (Titan G1), Lambda, and Terraform, designed to answer customer questions in real time based on a curated FAQ prompt. The frontend is deployed using AWS Amplify with a custom Route 53 domain, and all interactions are logged in DynamoDB for session tracking.

## How It Works

1. **User** types a question into the Amplify-hosted chatbot UI.
2. The frontend sends a `POST /chat` request via **API Gateway**.
   ![Postman Test](./screenshots/postman.png)
3. API Gateway invokes a **Lambda function**.
4. Lambda injects the user input into a pre-defined **FAQ prompt**.
5. The prompt is sent to **Amazon Bedrock (Titan G1)** and a response is returned.

6. Lambda returns the message and logs it into **DynamoDB**.

7. Session logs are viewable via DynamoDB and CloudWatch.

## Deployment with Terraform

Clone and deploy:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-customer-bot.git
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```

You will deploy:
- âœ… IAM roles & policies

- âœ… API Gateway

- âœ… DynamoDB table

- âœ… Route 53 + Amplify (custom domain setup via AWS Console)  
  The frontend was deployed using Amplify and connected to GitHub for CI/CD. A custom subdomain (`chatbot.fkvventures.com`) was added using Route 53.  
  SSL is managed by Amplify with AWS-managed ACM certificates.  
  Some parts of the setup â€” like domain connection and certificate validation â€” were done manually through the AWS Console due to Terraform limitations with Amplify and Route 53.
